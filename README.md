This is a fictional cinema website built using the Angular framework. The Main Page shows the movies scheduled for the current week (the database has March dates). The days change according to the current date. Click on the calendar icon to freely select the desired date. Click on the date to add films to the basket, which will be displayed on the Cashier page. Here you can enter a quantity, the price of the tickets is calculated according to this. It is also compulsory to enter a name and e-mail address. The ticket can be cancelled. The tickets you wish to purchase will be stored in Localstorage, so they will be kept even if the page is refreshed.
